/* 5. Write a program that takes as input 3 numbers a; b; and prints out the roots of the 
 * quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + = 0. Make sure that you handle all possible values of 
 * a,b,c without running into a division by zero or having to take the square root of a 
 * negative number. Even if the roots are complex, you should print them out suitably.
