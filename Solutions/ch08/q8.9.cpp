/* 
 * 9. Consider a circuit in which a voltage source of Vcc = 1.5 volts is applied to a diode
 * and a resistance of R = 1 Ohm connected in series, Figure 8.4. The current I through
 * a diode across which there is a potential drop of V is
 * I = Is[{e^(V/n.Vt)}-1]
 * where Is is the reverse saturation current of the diode, Vt is the thermal voltage which
 * is about 25 mV at room temperature (300 Kelvin), and n is the ideality factor. Suppose
 * the diode we are using has n = 1 and Is = 30 mA. Write a program that finds the
 * current. Use your program to also find the current when the voltage source is reversed.
