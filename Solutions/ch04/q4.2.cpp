/* 2. Here is an infinite product which can be shown to approach 2/pi as the number of terms
 * increases.
 * 2/pi =sqrt(2)/2.sqrt(2+sqrt(2))/2.sqrt(2+sqrt(2+sqrt(2)))/2...
 * Write a program that computes the product of the first n terms, where n is specifed as 
 * input. You will need to specify what values your variables take after some t iterations.
 * For this feel free to write something like "numerator has value sqrt(2 + sqrt(...+ sqrt(2))... with
 * sqrt() appearing t times". Write a proof of correctness.
