/* 8. Suppose you call the function gcd on consecutive Virahanka numbers Vn,Vn+1. There
 * is something interesting about the arguments to the successive recursive calls. What is
 * it? The depth of the recursion is defined to be the number of consecutive recursive calls
 * made, each nested inside the preceding one. What is the depth of the recursion for the
 * call gcd((Vn+1),V(n))? Based on this, argue that the time taken by gcd when called on n
 * bit numbers could be as large as n/2.
