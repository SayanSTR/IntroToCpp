1. Suppose the LCM computation program of Figure 11.1 has been written using a single
file, and it is noticed that only the function lcm has been declared and also defined,
all other functions are defined but not declared. Show how the program could appear
in the file.

                            Fig 11.1:

                    (a) The file gcd.cpp:
//===========================================================
int gcd(int m, int n){                                      =       
    int mdash,ndash;                                        =
    while(m % n != 0)                                       =
    {                                                       =
        mdash = n;                                          =
        ndash = m % n;                                      =
        m = mdash;                                          =
        n = ndash;                                          =
    }                                                       =
    return n;                                               =
}                                                           =
//===========================================================


                    (b) The file lcm.cpp:
//===========================================================
int gcd(int, int);  // declaration of function gcd          =
                                                            =
int lcm(int m, int n){                                      =
    return m*n/gcd(m,n);                                    =
}                                                           =
//===========================================================

                    (c) The file main.cpp:
//===========================================================
#include <simplecpp>                                        =
int lcm(int m, int n); // declaration of function lcm       =
                                                            =
int main(){                                                 =
    cout << lcm(36,24) << endl;                             =
}                                                           =
//===========================================================
