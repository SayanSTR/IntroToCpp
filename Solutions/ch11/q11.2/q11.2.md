2. The function passed to the bisection function took a float and returned a float.
However, we might well need to find the root of a function which takes a double and
returns a double. Also, it would be nice if the types of the other arguments were
likewise made double. Turn bisection into a template function so that it works for
both double and float types. You can of course also do this by overloading the name
bisection.
